# LaTeX Paper Updates - October 27, 2025

## Summary of Changes

I've updated your LaTeX paper (`LaTeX/main.tex`) to incorporate your new experimental findings on the four inversion methods and same-class convex combination sampling.

## Major Additions

### 1. New Section: "Inversion Methods for Bidirectional Diffusion"

This comprehensive section describes all four training approaches:

#### **Implicit Inversion**
- Two separate models (forward + inverse)
- Complete specialization but double parameters
- Mathematical formulation and trade-offs

#### **Semi-Implicit Inversion**  
- Single model with z-coordinate switch
- Four-loss training (forward, inverse, 2 roundtrips)
- Built-in consistency through roundtrip constraints

#### **Semi-Explicit Inversion (SVD-based)**
- Pseudo-inverse via Singular Value Decomposition
- Mathematical formulation: W‚Å∫ = VŒ£‚Åª¬πU^T
- No extra parameters, linear approximation

#### **Explicit Mathematical Inversion**
- True matrix and activation inversion
- Formulation: f‚Åª¬π(y) = W‚Åª¬π(œÉ‚Åª¬π(y) - b)
- Includes ReLU, tanh, sigmoid inversions

#### **Same-Class Convex Combination Sampling**
- Novel sampling strategy: xÃÉ·µ¢ = Œ±x·µ¢ + (1-Œ±)x‚±º where labels match
- Preserves semantic structure
- Prevents mixing features across classes

### 2. New Section: "Comparative Experimental Framework"

Details the 16-experiment design:
- 2 loss functions √ó 2 sampling methods √ó 4 training methods
- MNIST1D dataset with 2,000 samples
- Comprehensive metrics (MSE, MAE, KL, FID)
- Bidirectional evaluation

### 3. Updated "Results and Discussion"

Added placeholder tables for:
- **Table: Inversion Method Comparison** - MSE, FID, forward/inverse metrics
- **Table: Sampling Method Comparison** - Gaussian vs. convex
- Expected findings and hypotheses

### 4. Enhanced Methodology Section

Now includes:
- Both Gaussian and convex combination diffusion
- Mathematical formulation for same-class sampling
- Bidirectional training explanation
- Comparative evaluation framework

### 5. Updated Abstract

Expanded to mention:
- Four inversion approaches
- Same-class convex sampling
- 16-experiment framework
- Specific performance improvements (F1: 0.76 vs 0.65)

### 6. New Introduction Subsection: "Contributions"

Four numbered contributions highlighting:
1. Comprehensive inversion comparison
2. Same-class convex sampling innovation
3. Systematic experimental framework
4. Practical validation on real datasets

### 7. Updated Conclusion

Comprehensive summary including:
- Novel contributions
- Key findings from mass spec experiments
- Validation of utility-driven synthetic data

### 8. Expanded Future Work

New directions:
- Hybrid inversion methods
- Adaptive diffusion schedules
- Uncertainty quantification
- Larger-scale validation
- Theoretical analysis

## Tables to Populate

Once your experiments complete, you'll need to fill in these tables:

**Table: Inversion Method Comparison on MNIST1D**
```latex
Method & Test MSE & Test FID & Forward MSE & Inverse MSE
Implicit & -- & -- & -- & --
Semi-Implicit & -- & -- & -- & --
Semi-Explicit (SVD) & -- & -- & -- & --
Explicit & -- & -- & -- & --
```

**Table: Sampling Method Comparison**
```latex
Sampling & Test MSE & Test KL Div
Gaussian & -- & --
Same-Class Convex & -- & --
```

## How to Use Results

When your experiments finish:

1. Check `results/mnist1d_diffusion_experiments_*.json` for the results
2. Extract metrics for each of the 16 experiments
3. Fill in the placeholder tables with actual values
4. Add discussion of which methods performed best
5. Consider adding figures showing:
   - Training curves for each method
   - Sample quality comparisons
   - Forward vs inverse error trade-offs

## Suggested Additions (Optional)

### Figures You Could Add:

1. **Training Curves Comparison**
   - Plot loss over epochs for all 4 methods

   - Visual demonstration of semantic preservation

4. **Architectural Diagrams**
   - Show how z-switch works in semi-implicit
   - Illustrate SVD-based inversion process

### Analysis to Add:

1. **Statistical Significance**
   - Run t-tests comparing methods
   - Report p-values for performance differences

2. **Computational Cost Analysis**
   - Runtime comparison
   - Parameter count table
   - FLOPs analysis

3. **Ablation Studies**
