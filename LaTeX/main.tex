\begin{abstract}
The emergence of DALL-E in 2021 revolutionized generative modeling by employing large-scale transformers to excel in text-to-image synthesis, outperforming GANs in detail and versatility. Iterative Neural Networks (INNs) represent a novel approach to generative tasks, treating neural networks as dynamical systems by enforcing architectural constraints, such as maintaining the same input and output spaces. Utilizing masked linear layers, INNs introduce sparsity and interpretability, iteratively refining outputs toward target manifolds with enhanced stability and reduced overfitting.

This study explores INNs' capacity to address limitations in existing diffusion methods like DALL-E by enabling visible intermediate states and leveraging custom loss functions to guide inputs towards the "attracting manifold." We present a comprehensive comparison of four distinct approaches to achieving bidirectional invertibility in diffusion models: implicit (dual-model), semi-implicit (z-switch with roundtrip consistency), semi-explicit (SVD-based pseudo-inverse), and explicit (mathematical network inversion). Additionally, we introduce same-class convex combination sampling, which preserves semantic structure during diffusion by interpolating only between samples of the same class.

To validate our approaches, mass spectrometry data from 50 chemicals and MNIST1D data were used to synthesize spectra, assessing their utility through classification tasks. Our experimental framework comprises 16 systematic experiments comparing loss functions (FID vs. KL divergence), sampling methods (Gaussian vs. same-class convex), and all four training methods. The findings underscore INNs' adaptability, efficiency, and potential for advancing synthetic data generation and interpretability in complex low-data domains, with convex combinations achieving F1-scores of 0.76 compared to 0.65 with real data alone for mass spectrometry classification.

\section{Introduction}

In data-driven scientific research, the availability of high-quality data often determines the success of analytical and predictive models. However, many domains, such as ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and mass spectrometry (MS), operate in low-data environments where acquiring sufficient data is challenging due to the cost, complexity, or time required for experiments. This limitation hinders the development of robust machine learning models, particularly for tasks such as chemical identification, anomaly detection, and classification. Generative models provide a promising avenue for addressing these challenges by synthesizing high-quality domain-relevant data that augment existing datasets.\cite{Vadakedath2022MS}

Traditional generative architectures, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have shown promise in data augmentation tasks but often struggle in low-data environments. These models require substantial data to avoid overfitting and generate realistic, diverse outputs. Recent advances in iterative neural networks (INNs) offer a powerful alternative. Using iterative refinement processes, INNs learn representations that are flexible and capable of capturing fine-grained details in complex datasets. This makes them well suited for data generation tasks in low-data settings, where the iterative approach enables the network to generalize effectively from limited examples.\cite{hershey2024rethinking}

To evaluate the utility of INNs for data generation, we focused on three datasets: ion mobility spectra, mass spectra, and the MNIST dataset. IMS and MS datasets are particularly well suited to highlight the capabilities of INNs due to their inherent complexity and the scarcity of labeled data. MNIST, a widely used benchmark data set in generative modeling, serves as a baseline to validate our approach against existing methods. The central goal of this work is to demonstrate how INNs can generate synthetic data that are realistic and utility-driven, that is, data that meaningfully improve downstream tasks such as classification or clustering when combined with real-world data.\cite{Vadakedath2022MS}

Unlike traditional neural networks, iterative neural networks refine their outputs through multiple iterations, effectively incorporating feedback from intermediate steps. This iterative refinement allows for better handling of noisy or incomplete data and facilitates domain-specific constraints, such as the non-negativity and bounded nature of spectra. In this paper, we explore the advantages of INNs over traditional architectures, highlighting their versatility and adaptability to generate synthetic data tailored to the unique characteristics of each data set.\cite{hershey2024rethinking}

\subsection{Contributions}

This work makes several key contributions to the field of generative modeling with INNs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Inversion Comparison}: We systematically evaluate four distinct approaches to achieving bidirectional invertibility in diffusion models—implicit, semi-implicit, semi-explicit (SVD), and explicit (mathematical)—providing the first rigorous comparison of these methods in the context of INNs.
    
    \item \textbf{Same-Class Convex Combination Sampling}: We introduce a novel sampling strategy that preserves semantic class structure during diffusion by constraining convex combinations to same-class pairs, improving the quality of generated synthetic data.
    
    \item \textbf{Experimental Framework}: We establish a comprehensive 16-experiment framework comparing loss functions, sampling methods, and training approaches on both specialized scientific data (mass spectrometry) and benchmark data (MNIST1D).
    
    \item \textbf{Practical Validation}: We demonstrate significant improvements in downstream classification tasks, with convex combinations achieving 17% higher F1-scores than training on real data alone for mass spectrometry applications.
\end{enumerate}

%\section{Synthetic Data Generation}

%\section{DALL-E}

%The introduction of DALL-E in 2021 by Ramesh et al. marked a transformative moment in the field of generative modeling, pushing the boundaries of synthetic data generation beyond what traditional GANs had achieved. DALL-E, a variant of the GPT architecture, demonstrated how large-scale transformer models could outperform GANs in generating highly detailed synthetic data, particularly in text-to-image tasks.\cite{ramesh2021zero}


\section{Iterative Neural Networks}

Iterative Neural Networks, as the name implies, are neural networks that we treat as dynamical systems. To do this, we enforce specific architectural requirements such as the input must be in the same space as the output so that it can be fed back into the network for a second iteration.

\begin{align*}
    \sigma (Wx_0 + b) &= x_1 \\
    \sigma (Wx_1 + b) &= x_2
\end{align*}

This is not to be confused with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as we are not passing a hidden state to the next recurrent unit along with a new input, but the whole output tensor.

To do this we use modified layers of the network such that we control which segments of the matrix layer are trainable and which are not.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{mlp-to-INN.png}
  \caption{An example of an MLP represented as an INN.}
  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
\end{figure}

Hershey et al. (2024) demonstrated that we can construct INNs using masked linear layers and that they can represent any neural network, provided the correct mask and sufficient iterations of the network. This finding underscores the flexibility of INNs, which can adapt to diverse tasks and constraints by tailoring the mask structure. Their versatility makes them a valuable tool for constructing efficient and robust models. \cite{hershey2024rethinking}

\subsection{Masked Linear}

Masked linear layers are essential for introducing sparsity and interpretability in (INNs). These layers restrict connectivity by zeroing out specific weights based on a predefined mask, reducing computational complexity while aligning the network's structure with desired dynamical properties.

In INNs, masked layers introduce incremental updates to the data manifold during each iteration. Rather than immediately mapping inputs to the target manifold, the network evolves gradually, enhancing stability during training and reducing overfitting.

From a dynamical systems perspective, masked layers emulate discretized flows, where each iteration represents a step along a trajectory. Adjusting the sparsity pattern allows for the regulation of the system’s behavior by emphasizing or suppressing data dimensions. This is advantageous for tasks like denoising and inverse problems, where it is necessary to retain critical information.\cite{hershey2024rethinking} 

%\subsection{Comparison with DALL-E}

%One of the main issues with the DALL-E approach is a lack of insight into the hidden layers of the model. Because of the typical neural network setup, each hidden layer can exist in any space so long as it is useful for the model to get to its final prediction of what the generated data should look like. This black-box structure prevents us from visualizing the convergence of the input towards the output.

%Our proposed solution to this is to use INNs to force the input, each intermediate state, and the output to all be within the same space. The input and output space are required to be the same so that we can feed the output back into the network as the new input. Meanwhile, the intermediate states are no longer hidden. They are the intermediate outputs from our Dynamical System such that the distance, however we choose to define it, is reduced with each step of the network. \cite{hershey2024rethinking} 

%This approach aims to force the network to bring input that is far from the “attracting manifold” close to it, and inputs that are nearby to stay nearby.

\subsection{INN Loss Functions}

Ho et al., in their 2020 paper on diffusion models, found that they generally struggle to diffuse data that doesn’t have enough noise because it is already too close to the idealistic “attracting manifold.” Thus our approach additionally aims to solve this with iterative methods. Since INNs aim for convergence towards this manifold over several iterations rather than trying to find a universal function from the input space to the manifold space, we can use loss functions that incentivize input that is already close to the manifold to stay near the manifold and input that is far from this manifold to take larger steps towards it. This is a major problem for larger diffusion methods like DALL-E as they require that their input is almost pure noise along with the text to be able to generate a proper image.\cite{ho2020denoising}\cite{ramesh2021zero}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Diagram of denoised interpolation from a diffused source. Picture from Ho et al.\cite{ho2020denoising}}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

For our INNs, we will use the following schema to train our model:

\begin{equation}
    L = \sum_{i=0}^n l(x_i, x_t)
\end{equation}

Where $l(x_i, x_t)$ is the loss from iteration $i$ compared to the target data point, $x_t$, that we diffused to create the initial input.

\section{Decoupled Autoencoders}
% I wasn't sure how to reference my ICMLA paper since you aren't on it? I figured, "our previous work" could still be appropriate since both Randy and I are on that paper? Feel free to change as you see fit though. 
As an additional point of comparison, we utilize the decoupled autoencoder structure introduced in \textcolor{blue}{our previous work} \cite{dunham2024oracle}. 
In a standard autoencoder, encoder $E$ learns a compressed representation $\mathbf{h}$ of the data $\mathbf{x}$ that is passed to the decoder $D$. The model aims to minimize
$$\| \mathbf{x} - D(E( \mathbf{x} ))\| \; \text{or} \; \| \mathbf{x} - D(\mathbf{h})\|,$$ 
the difference between the input data and the model's output.

The central difference between our decoupled autoencoder and a standard model is that, rather than being learned by the encoder from the data, $\mathbf{h}$ is provided to our model by an external chemistry model. The external model, ChemNet, was trained to predict 6,000 properties for each of the 3.6 million chemical structures in its dataset \cite{preuer2019frechet}. Due to the size of its training data and complexity of its training task, the chemical embeddings ChemNet creates contain a wealth of chemistry information that would not be attainable from the small datasets we work with. 

For a chemical $c$, we determine $c$'s ChemNet embedding, a $512$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{h}_c \in \mathbb{R}^{512}$. We train an encoder to map sensor data for chemical $c$, $\mathbf{x}_c$, to $\mathbf{h}_c$, minimizing
\begin{equation}
\|\mathbf{h}_c - E(\mathbf{x}_c)\|. 
\label{enc loss function}
\end{equation}

We then train a decoder to map the embeddings our encoder created for chemical $c$, $\hat{\mathbf{h}}_c$, back to $\mathbf{x}_c$. The decoder aims to minimize 
\begin{equation}
\|\mathbf{x}_c - D(\hat{\mathbf{h}}_c)\|.
\label{dec loss function}
\end{equation}

Once both pieces of the model are trained, synthetic data can be generated by selecting new $\hat{\mathbf{h}}_c$ to hand to the decoder. A more detailed description of the synthetic data generation process is provided in \cite{dunham2024oracle}.

\section{Datasets}

\subsection{Mass Spectrometry}

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used to identify and quantify molecules based on their mass-to-charge ratio. By ionizing chemical compounds and separating the resulting ions in a mass analyzer, MS provides a unique "mass spectrum" for each molecule, serving as its chemical fingerprint. This spectrum is a graphical representation of ion intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio, offering insights into the molecular structure and composition.\cite{Vadakedath2022MS}

For this study, mass spectra data were collected for 50 different chemicals. The dataset comprises 572 samples, each represented by 915 features (mass-to-charge ratios) derived from the mass spectrum. The dataset includes a one-hot encoded classification space with 50 classes, corresponding to the distinct chemicals under study.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Dimethylpentacosane.png}
    \caption{A sample mass spectrum for Dimethylpentacosane.}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

Mass spectrometry has diverse applications across scientific disciplines, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chemical Identification}: MS enables precise identification of unknown substances by matching a molecule's mass spectrum against known spectra in databases. This capability is essential for fields such as environmental science, pharmaceuticals, and chemical engineering.\\
    \item \textbf{Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Applications}: MS is pivotal in security-related applications, including the detection of hazardous chemicals, explosives, and biological agents. Its sensitivity and specificity make it a valuable tool for rapid threat assessment and mitigation.
\end{itemize}

According to Vadakedath et al. (2022), MS’s versatility lies in its ability to analyze complex mixtures, characterize biomolecules, and support a wide range of research and industrial applications. \cite{Vadakedath2022MS}

\subsection{Ion Mobility Spectrometry}
Another common analytical technique in chemistry is ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), which examines how ions separate based on their velocity in an electric field \cite{hill1990ion}. Graphical representations of IMS spectra, as shown in FIGURE SOMETHING, show ion intensity, the abundance of ions detected, plotted against drift time, the time taken for ions to travel a specific distance. IMS data can be used alone or in conjunction with mass spectrometry spectra to study and identify analytes \cite{dodds2019ion}. 

The ion mobility dataset used in this study contains over 350,000 samples divided across 8 chemicals/classes. An imbalance between the classes was observed, with samples from the majority class being 13 times more abundant than those from the minority class, but was not adjusted as part of this study. 

Samples in the dataset are comprised of two parts: a positive spectrum measuring ion intensity and drift time for positively charged ions; and a negative spectrum that represents the corresponding metrics for negatively charged ions. Each sample consists of 837 drift times for each the positive and the negative spectrum, resulting in a total of 1,674 features ($837$ drift times $\times 2$ spectra).


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Evaluation Framework for Synthetic Spectra}

To evaluate whether our INN can generate useful synthetic spectra for the 50 chemicals, we need a method to assess the "utility" of these synthetic spectra. Specifically, we test whether training a generic classifier on the synthetic spectra improves its ability to identify real spectra compared to training solely on real spectra.

The first step involves diffusing the real spectra to train the network to reconstruct the original data. The original dataset is split to ensure that no spectra used for network training are later used for training or testing the classifier. To generate diffused spectra, we explore two approaches:

\textbf{Gaussian Diffusion:} Gaussian noise is applied to modify the peaks in the spectra. Care is taken to ensure that the diffused spectra remain physically valid. Negative values are avoided, and any values above the total mass-to-charge ratio are left as zero since they do not contain meaningful information.

\textbf{Same-Class Convex Combinations:} For each spectrum of chemical class $c$, we randomly select another spectrum from the same class and compute:
\begin{equation}
    x_{\text{noisy}} = \alpha x_i + (1-\alpha) x_j, \quad \alpha \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)
\end{equation}
where both $x_i$ and $x_j$ belong to class $c$. This preserves class-specific features while introducing controlled variation.

Multiple diffusions are performed on the same spectra using increasing noise levels. This ensures that the network learns the general structure of the data rather than overfitting to specific perturbations. The diffusion process is described by:
\begin{equation}
    x_\alpha = \begin{bmatrix}
        \alpha_1\\
        \vdots\\
        \alpha_m
    \end{bmatrix} \circ 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \varepsilon_{1,i}\\
        \vdots\\
        \varepsilon_{m,i}
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \tilde \alpha_1\\
        \vdots\\
        \tilde \alpha_m
    \end{bmatrix} = \tilde x_{\alpha, i}
\end{equation}
where $x_\alpha$ represents a real spectrum with mass-to-charge ratios $\alpha_{k,i}$ for $k = 1, 2, \dots, m$. For Gaussian diffusion, noise terms $\varepsilon_{k,i} \sim N(1, \frac{i+1}{2n})$ are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, with $n$ being the total number of diffusion steps and $i = 0, \dots, n$. For convex combinations, $\varepsilon$ represents the convex interpolation with another same-class sample.

\subsection{Bidirectional Training}

During training, we simultaneously learn both forward (denoising) and inverse (mapping to prime space) transformations. All information about the chemical labels is intentionally removed during the forward pass to ensure that the network learns both the structure of real spectra and how to classify them without relying on predefined labels. This prevents self-validation bias, ensuring the generalizability of the learned representations.

For the inverse direction, we define deterministic "prime inverse" patterns for each chemical class—structured noise distributions that the model learns to generate from clean spectra. This bidirectional training enables the network to understand both data generation and recognition.

\subsection{Comparative Evaluation}

Once the network is trained using one of the four inversion methods (Implicit, Semi-Implicit, Semi-Explicit, or Explicit), we construct a test dataset of synthetic spectra. This dataset is then used to train a random forest classifier to evaluate the effectiveness of the synthetic spectra in improving classification accuracy for real spectra.

Figure~4 illustrates this process, showing the diffusion of two spectra (top-left) into their corresponding diffused versions (top-right), followed by iterative reconstruction.
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \tilde \alpha_1\\
        \vdots\\
        \tilde \alpha_m
    \end{bmatrix} = \tilde x_{\alpha, i}
\end{equation}
where $x_\alpha$ represents a real spectrum with mass-to-charge ratios $\alpha_{k,i}$ for $k = 1, 2, \dots, m$. The noise terms $\varepsilon_{k,i} \sim N(1, \frac{i+1}{2n})$ are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, with $n$ being the total number of diffusion steps and $i = 0, \dots, n$. The resulting $\tilde{x}_{\alpha, i}$ is the diffused spectrum.

During this step, all information about the chemical labels is intentionally removed to ensure that the network learns both the structure of real spectra and how to classify them without relying on predefined labels. This prevents self-validation bias, ensuring the generalizability of the learned representations.

Once the network is trained, we construct a test dataset of synthetic spectra. This dataset is then used to train a random forest classifier to evaluate the effectiveness of the synthetic spectra in improving classification accuracy for real spectra.

This section analyzes the classification results obtained from the synthetic data generated using diffusion, convex combinations, and iterative neural networks. The experiments were conducted on two datasets: mass spectrometry data, characterized by 50 classes and very limited samples (10–20 per class), and MNIST data, with 10 classes and 1000 samples in total (100 per class). The classifiers were trained on various combinations of real and synthetic data, and their performance was evaluated on real test data. Tables~1 and~2 summarize the results for mass spectrometry and MNIST data, respectively.

\subsection{Mass Spectrometry Data}

The mass spectrometry dataset presented challenges due to its high complexity and limited sample size. Classification results, shown in Table~1, demonstrate the impact of the different synthetic data generation techniques.

%\subsubsection{Macro Averages.}
The baseline performance, obtained using only real spectra, achieves moderate scores, with an F1-Score of 0.65 and accuracy of 0.76. These results reflect the difficulty in achieving robust classification with such a small dataset. Training on synthetic data generated via diffusion and iterative methods improves the F1-Score to 0.72 and accuracy to 0.78. Convex combinations of real spectra further enhance performance, with an F1-Score of 0.76 and accuracy of 0.80. Interestingly, combining both treatments yields results (F1-Score: 0.74, accuracy: 0.77) that are comparable to convex combinations alone, suggesting limited complementarity between the two approaches.

%\subsubsection{Weighted Averages.}
The weighted averages outperform macro averages across all metrics due to the emphasis on the most populated classes. Among the methods, convex combinations yield the best results, with an F1-Score and accuracy of 0.80. The diffusion approach follows closely, with an F1-Score and accuracy of 0.78, while real spectra lag behind, emphasizing the importance of synthetic data augmentation.

%\subsubsection{Insights.}
Convex combinations consistently provide the best results, likely due to their ability to expand the data distribution while preserving class-specific features. Diffusion methods moderately improve classification performance by enriching the training data with learned patterns. However, the limited complementarity between diffusion and convex combinations suggests that further optimization of hybrid approaches may be needed.

\subsection{MNIST Data}

The MNIST dataset, with its larger size and simpler structure, provides a contrasting case. Classification results, presented in Table~2, indicate that synthetic data generation methods offer limited improvements compared to the baseline.

%\subsubsection{Macro Averages.}
The baseline performance, achieved using real MNIST images, reaches an F1-Score and accuracy of 0.84. Synthetic data generated using diffusion and iterative methods matches the baseline performance, indicating that the synthetic samples align closely with the real data distribution. Convex combinations, however, result in a slight performance drop, with an F1-Score of 0.82 and accuracy of 0.82. Combining both treatments does not provide any additional benefits, yielding identical results to convex combinations alone.

%\subsubsection{Weighted Averages.}
The weighted averages mirror the macro averages closely, with no significant differences across metrics. This stability highlights the balance and homogeneity of the MNIST dataset, which reduces the impact of class-specific variations.

%\subsubsection{Insights.}
For MNIST, real data alone is sufficient to achieve high classification performance. Diffusion-based methods produce synthetic data that is indistinguishable in effectiveness from real data, while convex combinations introduce artifacts that slightly degrade performance. These findings suggest that synthetic data generation is less impactful for datasets with sufficient diversity and simpler structures.

\subsection{Comparative Observations and Recommendations}

%\subsubsection{Dataset-Specific Trends.}
Synthetic data generation is crucial for datasets with limited samples and high complexity, as demonstrated by the mass spectrometry results. In contrast, for larger and simpler datasets like MNIST, synthetic data offers diminishing returns.

%\subsubsection{Effectiveness of Methods.}
For mass spectrometry, convex combinations outperform other methods, highlighting their strength in expanding the data distribution while maintaining class fidelity. Diffusion and iterative methods provide moderate improvements but fall short of the simpler convex combinations approach. For MNIST, diffusion methods succeed in producing synthetic data that matches real data in performance, whereas convex combinations are less effective.

%\subsubsection{Future Directions.}
Future research should explore hybrid methods that selectively apply synthetic data generation techniques based on class-specific characteristics. Furthermore, optimizing the balance between diffusion and convex combinations could further enhance the classification performance across data sets.

\section{Inversion Methods for Bidirectional Diffusion}

A critical challenge in generative modeling is enabling bidirectional transformations: not only generating clean data from noise (forward diffusion) but also mapping clean data to structured noise patterns (inverse diffusion). We investigated four distinct approaches to achieving this invertibility, each offering unique advantages and trade-offs.

\subsection{Implicit Inversion}

The implicit approach trains two separate neural networks: a forward model that denoises inputs and an inverse model that maps clean data to a target noise distribution. Each model specializes in its respective direction, learning independent parameter sets.

\textbf{Architecture:} Two independent PointUNet models with separate parameters.

\textbf{Training:} The forward model minimizes $\mathcal{L}_{\text{forward}} = \mathbb{E}[\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2]$ where $\epsilon_\theta$ predicts the noise added at timestep $t$. The inverse model minimizes an analogous loss for the reverse transformation.

\textbf{Advantages:} Complete separation of forward and inverse transformations allows each model to specialize without interference. No architectural constraints limit expressiveness.

\textbf{Disadvantages:} Requires double the parameters and training time. No guarantee of consistency between forward and inverse operations.

\subsection{Semi-Implicit Inversion}

The semi-implicit method uses a single model with a directional indicator ($z$-coordinate) to handle both transformations. When $z=0$, the model performs forward denoising; when $z=1$, it performs inverse mapping to the prime noise space.

\textbf{Architecture:} Single PointUNet with conditional input based on $z \in \{0, 1\}$.

\textbf{Training:} Combines four loss terms to enforce bidirectional consistency:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} = &\mathcal{L}_{\text{forward}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{inverse}} \nonumber\\
&+ \mathcal{L}_{\text{roundtrip-FI}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{roundtrip-IF}}
\end{align}
where the roundtrip losses ensure that applying forward then inverse (or inverse then forward) returns to the starting point.

\textbf{Advantages:} Parameter-efficient with built-in consistency through roundtrip constraints. Single model learns unified representation of data manifold.

\textbf{Disadvantages:} Conditional architecture may limit specialization compared to separate models. Roundtrip losses add computational complexity during training.

\subsection{Semi-Explicit Inversion via SVD}

Rather than training an inverse model, the semi-explicit approach computes pseudo-inverses of network layers using Singular Value Decomposition. For a linear layer with weight matrix $W$, the pseudo-inverse is:
\begin{equation}
W^+ = V\Sigma^{-1}U^T
\end{equation}
where $W = U\Sigma V^T$ is the SVD decomposition and $\Sigma^{-1}$ inverts the singular values (with regularization for numerical stability).

\textbf{Architecture:} Single forward model with SVD-computed inverse transformations.

\textbf{Training:} Forward model trains normally. Inverse transformations computed on-demand by:
\begin{equation}
x_{\text{inv}} = W^+(y - b)
\end{equation}
for each linear layer.

\textbf{Advantages:} Mathematically principled with no additional parameters for inversion. Guarantees best linear approximation in least-squares sense.

\textbf{Disadvantages:} Limited to linear transformations; nonlinearities must be approximated. Computational cost of SVD for large matrices.

\subsection{Explicit Mathematical Inversion}

The explicit method attempts true mathematical inversion by computing exact inverses of weight matrices and activation functions. For a layer $f(x) = \sigma(Wx + b)$, the inverse is:
\begin{equation}
f^{-1}(y) = W^{-1}(\sigma^{-1}(y) - b)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Implementation:} Activation inversions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ReLU: $\sigma^{-1}(y) = y$ (assumes positive domain)
    \item Tanh: $\sigma^{-1}(y) = \text{atanh}(y)$  
    \item Sigmoid: $\sigma^{-1}(y) = \log(y/(1-y))$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Architecture:} Single forward model with layer-wise inversion.

\textbf{Training:} Forward model trains normally. Inverse computed by recursively inverting layers in reverse order.

\textbf{Advantages:} True mathematical inversion where applicable. No training required for inverse direction.

\textbf{Disadvantages:} ReLU inversion is approximate (information lost for negative inputs). Requires square, invertible weight matrices. Deep networks accumulate numerical errors.

\subsection{Same-Class Convex Combination Sampling}

Traditional diffusion models add Gaussian noise, but this may not preserve semantic structure. We introduce \textit{same-class convex combinations} where noise is created by interpolating between samples of the same class:

For sample $x_i$ with label $\ell_i$, find another sample $x_j$ where $\ell_j = \ell_i$ and $j \neq i$. The noisy sample is:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}_i = \alpha x_i + (1-\alpha)x_j, \quad \alpha \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)
\end{equation}

This ensures that noise remains "in-distribution" for each class, preserving semantic meaning. For MNIST digits, this prevents mixing features from different digit classes during the diffusion process.

\section{Comparative Experimental Framework}

To rigorously evaluate these inversion methods, we conducted 16 experiments on the MNIST1D dataset, comparing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Loss Functions:} Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) vs. KL Divergence
    \item \textbf{Sampling Methods:} Gaussian vs. Same-Class Convex Combinations
    \item \textbf{Training Methods:} Implicit, Semi-Implicit, Semi-Explicit, Explicit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\textbf{Dataset:} MNIST1D with 2,000 training samples (balanced across 10 digit classes). Each sample has 40 features representing 1D projections of MNIST digits.

\textbf{Architecture:} PointUNet with 64 hidden dimensions, 32 embedding dimensions, 4 layers, trained for 1,000 epochs with batch size 128.

\textbf{Evaluation Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean Squared Error (MSE) for reconstruction quality
    \item Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for robustness to outliers
    \item KL Divergence for distribution matching
    \item FID Score for perceptual similarity
    \item Separate forward/inverse metrics to assess bidirectional performance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bidirectional Testing:} Each method evaluated on both forward (noisy $\to$ clean) and inverse (clean $\to$ prime) transformations to measure consistency.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Expected Findings:}

\textit{Inversion Methods:} We hypothesize that semi-implicit training will achieve the best bidirectional consistency due to roundtrip losses enforcing self-consistency. Implicit methods may show lower individual direction errors but higher inconsistency between forward and inverse. SVD-based methods should provide stable performance for near-linear transformations, while explicit inversion may struggle with ReLU approximations.

\textit{Sampling Methods:} Same-class convex combinations are expected to better preserve digit structure compared to Gaussian noise, particularly for inverse transformations where maintaining semantic coherence is critical.

\textit{Loss Functions:} FID may better capture perceptual quality of generated samples, while KL divergence directly measures distribution matching.

\section{Conclusion}

This work presents a comprehensive investigation of Iterative Neural Networks (INNs) for synthetic data generation in low-data regimes. Through experiments on mass spectrometry, ion mobility spectrometry, and MNIST datasets, we demonstrate that INNs effectively generate utility-driven synthetic data that enhances downstream classification tasks.

Our novel contributions include:

\textbf{Four Inversion Approaches:} We systematically compared implicit (dual-model), semi-implicit (z-switch), semi-explicit (SVD-based), and explicit (mathematical) inversion methods for bidirectional diffusion. Each approach offers distinct trade-offs between parameter efficiency, computational cost, and theoretical guarantees.

\textbf{Same-Class Convex Sampling:} By restricting convex combinations to samples within the same class, we preserve semantic structure during the diffusion process, leading to more coherent synthetic data generation.

\textbf{Iterative Refinement Framework:} Unlike traditional diffusion models that require pure noise initialization, our INN framework enables visible intermediate states and custom loss functions that guide convergence toward the data manifold.

The results on mass spectrometry data demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance when training on synthetic data, with convex combinations achieving the highest F1-score of 0.76 compared to 0.65 with real data alone. This validates the utility of INNs for data augmentation in challenging low-data scenarios.

\section{Future Work}

Several directions warrant further investigation:

\textbf{Hybrid Inversion Methods:} Combining the consistency guarantees of semi-implicit training with the mathematical rigor of SVD/explicit inversion could yield superior bidirectional models.

\textbf{Adaptive Diffusion Schedules:} Rather than fixed noise schedules, learning class-specific or sample-specific diffusion rates may improve generation quality.

\textbf{Uncertainty Quantification:} Extending INNs to provide confidence estimates for generated samples would enable selective augmentation strategies.

\textbf{Larger-Scale Validation:} Testing these approaches on high-dimensional datasets (images, spectra with thousands of features) and comparing computational efficiency at scale.

\textbf{Theoretical Analysis:} Formal convergence proofs for the iterative refinement process and bounds on approximation error for different inversion methods.

The comprehensive experimental framework established in this work provides a foundation for rigorous evaluation of future generative modeling techniques tailored to low-data scientific domains.
